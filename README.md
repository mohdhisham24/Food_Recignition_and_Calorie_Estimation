Academic project on ML

Delighted to showcase my Academic project focused on food recognition and calorie estimation, where we have developed a state-of-the-art machine learning model. By harnessing the capabilities of deep learning and computer vision, our project offers an automated solution for accurately identifying various food items and estimating their caloric content. This transformative endeavor aims to revolutionize the way we analyze and manage our diets, promoting healthier lifestyles. Follow our project to stay updated on the latest advancements in machine learning for dietary analysis and join us on this exciting journey towards a better understanding of nutrition.

Project Title:

Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation


Project Overview:

Your project revolves around a state-of-the-art machine learning model designed to automate the identification of various food items and estimate their caloric content.
The focus of the project is on the Indian food market.
Objective:

Revolutionize the way people analyze and manage their diets, promoting healthier lifestyles through accurate dietary analysis.


Dataset:

Curated a specialized dataset exclusively focusing on Indian food items.
Highlight the significance of this dataset for targeting the Indian market.



Technology Stack:

Deep learning and computer vision techniques are employed to achieve accurate food item identification and calorie estimation.
Streamlit was used for building the front end of the application.


Key Features:

Automated food item recognition: The system uses a Covolutional Neural Network model to recognize the food Image input from the user and estimate the calorie for the same.

Project Status:

The Mobile Application prototype was designed with Figma and utility of the model was showcased using a front end system streamlit


Getting Started:

You can run the code on google collab and install the libraries. The notebok file is in the repo. It is pretty self explanatory
